# 🎨 Da‑Vinci App Organization

Welcome to the **Da‑Vinci App** GitHub organization. This space contains all repositories, prototypes, and planning resources used to design, build, and evolve the Da‑Vinci application.

Our goal is to keep development **clear, organized, and collaborative** while moving quickly from prototype to production.

## ✅ Development Rules (Important)

To keep the organization clean and maintainable, **all contributors must follow these rules**:

* ✍️ **Commit messages must accurately describe what was added or changed**
  *Bad:* `update`
  *Good:* `Add user authentication middleware`

* 💾 **Always commit after you finish working on a repository**
  Avoid leaving uncommitted changes or unfinished work in your local environment.

These rules help with:

* Easier debugging
* Clear project history
* Faster onboarding for new contributors

## 🧭 Workflow Overview

1. Pick a task from the **Task List** or your **Personal Tasks** view
2. Create or update a branch as needed
3. Make focused, well-described commits
4. Commit when your work is complete
5. Review the **Roadmap** to ensure alignment with project goals

## 🚀 Project Status

The Da‑Vinci App is under **active development** with multiple parallel prototypes feeding into a unified frontend and backend.

Expect:

* Iteration
* Refactoring
* Feature consolidation

---

## 💡 Notes & Best Practices

* Keep prototypes experimental, but **document key learnings**
* Prefer small, meaningful commits over large catch‑all commits
* If unsure where work belongs, check the roadmap or task board first
